# Security Policy

## Scope

Sidequests runs entirely locally. It does not expose any network services beyond the local dev server (`localhost:3000`). There is no authentication layer — it is designed for single-user, local use.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer directly (see profile for contact info) or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.
3. Include steps to reproduce and any relevant details.

You should receive acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand the scope and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release on `main` is supported with security fixes.
