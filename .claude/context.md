## Project Anchor

**Project:** Projects Dashboard — local web app scanning ~/dev for a bird's-eye view of all projects
**Current Phase:** Phases 32-33 complete + visual QA fixes. Project closed out for now.

## Git State

**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** 6d85790 phases 32-33: settings UI, score re-architecture, visual QA fixes
**Uncommitted Changes:** None (clean working tree)

## What We Did This Session

### Visual QA with Playwright
Ran comprehensive headed Playwright tests across all dashboard flows:
- Dashboard overview, stats bar, filter tabs, search
- Project drawer (3 projects), drawer scroll through all sections
- Settings modal, refresh/enrich buttons, split enrich dropdown
- Keyboard navigation, pin functionality
- Responsive views (tablet, mobile)
- Score column close-up

### Fixes Implemented from QA Findings

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Needs Attention 11/13 too aggressive | Tightened: hygiene <30, momentum <25, TODOs >=20, unpushed >7d → now 7/13 |
| 2 | Score column no legend | Split into separate **Hygiene** + **Momentum** columns with full names + tooltips |
| 3 | Blue status dot unclear | Added title tooltip on status dot column header with color legend |
| 4 | No Paused tab | Added Paused tab; Active no longer includes paused projects |
| 5 | Stats don't update when filtered | Stats bar shows "X / Y" format when tab/search active |
| 6 | Settings Save button hidden below fold | Moved Save button outside scroll area, sticky with border-top |
| 7 | Enrich dropdown accessibility | Added aria-haspopup, aria-expanded, role="menu", role="menuitem" |
| 8 | Keyboard shortcuts | **Removed entirely** per user decision (nobody will use them) |
| 9 | Actions column misaligned | Left-aligned header, fixed 7rem column width |
| 10 | __pycache__ in git | Added to .gitignore |

### Committed
Single commit `6d85790` — 36 files, +3,563 / -817 lines. Covers phases 32-33 (settings UI, score re-architecture, delta provenance, AI insights, attention engine) plus all visual QA fixes.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Files |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Remove all keyboard shortcuts | User: "nobody will use it" | page.tsx |
| Separate Hygiene + Momentum columns | "hyg/mom" was unclear, full names better | project-list.tsx |
| Actions header left-aligned, 7rem fixed | Align with VS Code icon start | project-list.tsx |
| Attention thresholds: hyg<30, mom<25 | 11/13 needing attention was meaningless signal | attention.ts |
| Skip mobile fixes | User: "desktop only app" | — |
| Paused tab only shows if count > 0 | Avoid empty tab clutter | page.tsx |

## Next Actions

1. **Phase 34** — Calibration/backfill tooling (codex review Task 5 in `.claude/codex-review.md`)
2. **Run Scan + Enrich** — Populate hygiene/momentum/aiInsight data for all projects with new scoring
3. **Consider further tightening** — Needs Attention at 7/13 is still over half; may want to revisit thresholds after seeing real data

## Conversation Essence

- Codex Review doc at `.claude/codex-review.md` has full research (DORA, SPACE, OpenSSF) and 5-task breakdown
- Phase 33 plan at `.claude/phase-33-plan.md` has scoring formulas and file ownership map
- User is closing this project for now — all work committed, clean tree
- Old `/api/config` route still exists but is dead code (superseded by `/api/settings`)
- Color scheme: orange/gold, NOT purple
- Working model: Claude implements, Codex reviews/architects, user mediates
- User prefers Opus for agents, honest code review, brainstorming before implementing
- Playwright is installed in project node_modules (not global) — scripts must run from project dir
