## Project Anchor

**Project:** Projects Dashboard v2 — local web app scanning ~/dev to provide bird's-eye view of all projects
**Current Phase:** Wave A of Phases 11-21 complete (Phase 11 + Phase 13). Transforming from "portfolio tracker" to "daily starting point" tool.

## Git State

**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** 7ae61d1 phase 10: soft-prune missing projects on refresh
**Uncommitted Changes:**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Added Phases 11-21 with agent team strategy (11 new phases)
- `pipeline/scan.py` — Phase 11: 15 new fields (git dirty, ahead/behind, recent commits, framework, services, LOC, scripts, package manager, license)
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Phase 13: Replaced card grid with `<ProjectList>` compact list view
- `src/components/project-list.tsx` — NEW: Compact list component (~40px rows, CSS grid, responsive)

## What We Were Doing

### Task
Major UX + backend overhaul to transform the dashboard from a portfolio tracker into a "daily starting point" tool. Planned and executing 11 new phases (11-21) using agent teams for parallel development.

### Progress
- [x] Research phase: Spun up 3-agent research team (frontend, backend, product) for deep analysis
- [x] Implementation plan: Added Phases 11-21 to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with agent team wave strategy
- [x] **Phase 11 (Wave A):** Enhanced scan.py — 15 new fields per project (git status, ahead/behind, recent commits, framework detection, services, LOC, scripts, package manager, license)
- [x] **Phase 13 (Wave A):** Compact list view — replaced card grid with dense ~40px rows, CSS grid layout, responsive, build passes
- [ ] **Phase 12:** Schema Evolution & Derive v2 (Wave B — next)
- [ ] **Phase 14:** Sort, Filter & Recently Active (Wave B — next)
- [ ] **Phase 15:** Drawer Redesign (Wave C)
- [ ] **Phase 16:** API & Merge Updates (Wave C)
- [ ] **Phase 17:** Enhanced Quick Actions (Wave D)
- [ ] **Phase 18:** Project Pinning & Favorites (Wave D)
- [ ] **Phase 19:** Pipeline Optimizations (Wave D)
- [ ] **Phase 20:** Session Memory & Activity Timeline (Wave E)
- [ ] **Phase 21:** Docs & Architecture Update (Wave F)

### Where We Stopped
Wave A complete (Phase 11 + 13). All changes are uncommitted. Build passes. User was about to either view the app in browser or kick off Wave B.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Files |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Replace cards with compact list | Cards too dense, ~6-9 visible vs 25+ with list rows | project-list.tsx, page.tsx |
| 15 new scan fields in scan.py | Git dirty/ahead-behind, framework, services are the most-wanted missing data | scan.py |
| "in-progress" → "paused" (Phase 12) | 15-60 days inactive isn't "in progress" — planned for derive v2 | derive.py (not yet) |
| Agent team waves A-F | Backend + frontend can parallelize; clear dependency graph | IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md |
| Keep project-card.tsx | May bring back as toggle view option later | — |
| Don't deprioritize anything | User explicitly said include all recommendations | IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md |

## Next Actions

1. **Commit Wave A changes** (if user approves)
2. **Kick off Wave B:** Phase 12 (schema evolution + derive v2) + Phase 14 (sort/filter/recently active)
3. Or: Start dev server to visually verify the new list view first

## Conversation Essence

- User discovered the auto-memory feature (v2.1.32) — keeping both auto-memory and /context-save for now, as they serve different purposes
- Used agent teams (new feature) for both research and implementation — user explicitly requested this workflow
- Research team found the core problem: dashboard answers "what do I have?" but not "what was I doing?"
- Key missing signals: git dirty status (#1), recent commits, sort-by-recency, framework detection
- Dead fields discovered: Override.manualJson, Llm.takeawaysJson — never read in merge.ts
- Activity model exists but is never surfaced in UI — Phase 20 will fix this
- User's framework for projects: every project has PITCH.md + IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md + ARCHITECTURE.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md and PITCH.md updates deferred to after implementation (Phase 21)
